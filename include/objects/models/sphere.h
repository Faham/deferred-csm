/*
 * Definition of sphere geometry.
 *
 * You can create spheres that are approximated by
 * different numbers of triangles by varying the
 * parameter of the init() function.
 *
 * init() will perform a recursive tessellation
 * of an octahedron to arrive at an approximation
 * to a sphere by triangles.
 *
 * The sphere is centered at (0,0,0) and has radius 1
